## Features

* **Responsive Layout**: The user interface adapts to different screen sizes using modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid.
* **Contact Form**: A fully functional contact form that uses JavaScript for client-side validation. Submissions are handled by the Formspree service and forwarded via email.
* **Dynamic To-Do List**: An interactive to-do list application where users can add and remove tasks. All tasks are saved to the browser's `localStorage`, so they persist even after a page refresh.

---

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the web page.
* **CSS3**: For styling, layout, and responsiveness.
* **JavaScript (ES6)**: For form validation, DOM manipulation, and interacting with `localStorage`.
* **Git & GitHub**: For version control and deployment via GitHub Pages.
